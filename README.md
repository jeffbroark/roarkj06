 Java Sorting Programs
This repository contains two Java programs that demonstrate sorting a collection of numbers. The first program uses a LinkedList to store and sort the numbers, while the second program uses a Stack.
 Programs:
Mod04: SortedLinkedList
File: SortedLinkedList.java
Description:
This program reads a list of numbers from the input, stores them in a linked list, and sorts them in ascending order. The numbers are read from the user until the keyword "done" is entered. The sorted list is then printed out.
Usage:
1. Compile the program:
  javac SortedLinkedList.java   
2. Run the program:
     java SortedLinkedList
 3. Enter numbers separated by spaces, then type 'done' to finish the input and display the sorted list.

Example:
Enter numbers separated by a space and press Enter, then type 'done' and press Enter to finish:
5 3 8 1 2
 done
Sorted list: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

Mod05: Sorted Stack
File: SortedStack.java

Description:
This program reads a list of numbers from the input, stores them in a stack, and sorts them in ascending order. The numbers are read from the user until the keyword "done" is entered. The sorted stack is then printed out.
Usage:
1. Compile the program:
  javac SortedStack.java   
2. Run the program:
     java SortedStack
 3. Enter numbers separated by spaces, then type 'done' to finish the input and display the sorted Stack.
Example:
Enter numbers separated by a space and press Enter, then type 'done' and press Enter to finish:
5 3 8 1 2 
done
Sorted stack:
1
2
3
5
8
